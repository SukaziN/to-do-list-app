# To-Do-List

This is a to-do-list to help plan daily tasks or activities. Each of the tasks on the list can be moved up and down based on where they rank on the priority scale. The application also offers a delete option for tasks that the user chooses not to do (likely because they form part of the examplar guide) or has completed.

## For user preference

The app is equipped with an option to switch between light and dark mode.
